# PlethysmographyMatlabCode
Custom written code for the analysis of outcomes from whole animal plethysmography experiments.

This program takes a folder of excel sheets containing manually selected respiratory waveform from LabChart with calculated respiratory parameters (Vf, VT, VTg, VE, VO2, VCO2, VE/VO2) from each of these selections. It then produces graphs and statistics, separately, from these selections.
